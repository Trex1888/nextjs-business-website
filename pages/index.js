            BUILDING APIs TO CONNECT YOUR BUSINESS
          </h2>
          <p className="px-2 pt-4">
            PROBLEM: Our partner has an internal tool used by marketing for
            customers to purchase software. As business needs have changed, the
            amount of flexibility needed for new products and marketing
            initiatives has increased. The current application is built upon
            monolithic architecture, which prevents flexibility and the
            necessary agility to compete in todayâ€™s market. <br /> <br />{" "}
            SOLUTION: Our team created a new application utilizing a
            microservice architecture to act as RESTful APIs. This design
            reduces code complexity, allows rapid changes, decreases response
            time, and provides a high level of reliability. With this new
            platform, the team was able to automate several manual processes,
            reduced errors, and allowed marketing to set up new incentives in
            minutes. We also added additional functionality that resulted in
            market penetration and increased sales. <br /> <br /> TECH STACK:
            AWS (ECS Fargate & Elasticsearch), Docker, React, Node.js, Java,
            RESTful APIs
