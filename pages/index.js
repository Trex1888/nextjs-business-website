            problem=": A partner of ours has an internal tool used by marketing for customers
            to purchase software. As business needs have changed, the amount of
            flexibility needed for new products and marketing has increased. The
            current application is built upon monolithic architecture, which
            prevents flexibility and the necessary agility to compete in todayâ€™s
            market."
            solution=": Our team was able to create a new application with microservice
            architecture to act as RESTful APIs. This design reduces code
            complexity, allows rapid changes, decreases response time, and
            provides a high level of reliability. With this new platform, the team
            was able to automate several manual processes, reduced errors, and
            allowed marketing to set up new incentives in minutes. We also added
            additional functionality that resulted in market penetration and
            increased sales."
