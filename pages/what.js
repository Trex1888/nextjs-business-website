            Their products reduce noise, noticeable vibration, and wear-and-tear, resulting in longevity 
            and enhanced performance. Currently, there are no mobile solutions for these products. 
            Their marketing team was concerned that there wasnâ€™t enough brand awareness within the market 
            and sought to increase adoption with a mobile app."
            solution=": Our team did extensive user research, and determined it was necessary to develop both 
            an iOS and Android mobile application. These two solutions give users access to product 
            information and provide descriptions for the most common issues/terms. It also includes 
            a sizing program to help users pick the right product for their environment. 
            This application has been adopted worldwide and is currently being used in 32 different countries."
