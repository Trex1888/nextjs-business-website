          <span className="text-black text-xl font-medium">PROBLEM</span>: A
          partner of ours has an internal tool used by marketing for customers
          to purchase software. As business needs have changed, the amount of
          flexibility needed for new products and marketing has increased. The
          current application is built upon monolithic architecture, which
          prevents flexibility and the necessary agility to compete in todayâ€™s
          market. <br /> <br />
          <span className="text-black text-xl font-medium">SOLUTION</span>: Our
          team was able to create a new application with microservice
          architecture to act as RESTful APIs. This design reduces code
          complexity, allows rapid changes, decreases response time, and
          provides a high level of reliability. With this new platform, the team
          was able to automate several manual processes, reduced errors, and
          allowed marketing to set up new incentives in minutes. We also added
          additional functionality that resulted in market penetration and
          increased sales. <br /> <br />
